# cet-poc

The customer is a company quite familiar with the EVM principles, planning to launch a new dapp, but who never used any consensys products. They reached out to the Customer Enablement Team of Consensys to see how consensys products could be used for building their dapp.

Thei dApp will. be a lending and borrowing platform where end-users can collateralize an NFT to borrow money.

Guidlines:
Develop a PoC demonstrate how one or many Consensys Products can be used for the customr's purpose. It is not expected that the PoC covers all the features of a lending/borrowing platform, but instead, to cherry-pick a very limited number of features that would allow you to showcase Consensys products integration and help the customer to clear any technical difficulties he would have.

Whole on a kickoff call with the customer, you are asked to describe the PoC you will create. What features will it provide and which Consensys products will be used?

Tips:

- Focus on where you think that technical complexity would rely on the customer (eg: the dApp will probably have to list the tokens owned by one user: how should the customer use infura to get the list of tokens owned by a user)

- The customer brief is unclear on purpose. Think ahead about the interrogations and expectations of the customer (eg: why not use Linea for my dApp?)

- There is no right or wrong answer, you are here to demostrate your strengths (and not expose you weakness too much)
